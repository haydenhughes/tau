# Tau Ï„

The very hacked together physics engine.

Made for me to better learn kinematics.

## ToDo:
 - [] Electron object
 - [] Magnets

## Basic Usage
```python
from Tau import PointMass, Tau

app = Tau()

mass = PointMass(400, 300)

app.add_objects(mass)
app.run()
```

## Licence
Tau is distributed under the MIT Licence.
